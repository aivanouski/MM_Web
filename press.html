				<div class="body">
					<p localizerid="faq-3">
Those who are unfamiliar with the global remittance industry may be surprised to learn that it is a multi-billion dollar market. The world bank estimates that officially recorded remittances to developing countries amounted to $429 billion in 2016.


A remittance is a transfer of money by a foreign worker to an individual in his or her home country. These cross-border transfers are economically significant for many countries that receive them. Remittances often compete with foreign aid as the largest capital inflow for developing nations. It is safe to say that many economies rely on remittances to survive.

In many of these developing nations less than 20-30% of the citizenry have bank accounts. The other 70% of the population is without access to a bank or financial services and have been deemed “the unbanked”.


Workers sending home money home via Western Union, which can charge up to 15% of the transferred funds
In order for the unbanked to receive funds they must use a money transfer operator (MTO). However, this presents several challenges because the system must have adequate geographical coverage of MTOs and these MTOs rely on a complex web of banks to transfer and re-balance funds.

The issue revolves around access to local currency and the network of banks needed to transact. An MTO sender may have a significant cash balance, whereas the receiving MTO may have a large digital balance.

Traditionally they would be forced to go through banks in order to re-balance. This is where cryptocurrency advocates see an opportunity to streamline the process by removing banks all together. This is made possible by the blockchain, the same technology that powers Bitcoin.

One project, Bitspark, is working to leverage blockchain technology to revolutionize the remittance industry. Bitspark is a remittance platform for money transfer businesses.


Bitspark is a remittance service using cryptocurrency to send and receive value
In August, Bitspark announced they would be building their service on the BitShares blockchain. The BitShares platform itself is built to scale to 100,000 transactions per second with fees as low as fractions of cents and confirmation times sub 3 seconds.

Aside from providing a fast and efficient payment platform, BitShares allows for the creation of Market Pegged Assets (MPA). Market Pegged Assets are freely traded digital assets whose value is meant to track that of a conventional underlying asset such as CNY, gold or USD

Bitspark is proposing the use of pegged cryptocurrency such as bitUSD to solve the re-balancing problem. A recent blog post showed an example of how this would function. “A Bitspark Sendy (mobile app) user has a digital balance of 100 bitUSD in their app and would like to make some money. They visit an MTO and offer to sell their digital 100 bitUSD to the MTO for $101 in Cash. The MTO accepts this offer and exchanges $101 in cash for 100 bitUSD. The MTO now has reduced their cash on hand and also received a digital balance to be used for future transactions.”


Bitspark created mobile app called “Sendy” to help with remittances
In the current system, the MTO would need to take their cash to a bank and wait for the bank to credit it into their money transfer system providers account before sending transactions again. MPAs eliminate the need for a bank to provide liquidity allowing MTOs to operate without the need for a bank account.

Bitspark is removing the difficulty associated with accessing liquidity denominated in the local currency, with the goal of creating a pegged fiat cryptocurrency for every national currency in the world with zero counterparty risk and exchangeable for virtually no cost. The new payment method will be rolled out slowly for specific currency pairs so that Bitspark’s remittance users will have access to all of the world’s 180+ currencies over the coming months, bringing financial services to the unbanked.

It is estimated that there are 2 billion unbanked people, who use cash only, do not have any credit history or access to any financial services. Bitspark is not the only company looking to capitalize on this untapped market.



MicroMoney Credit Assessment and Micro-loan platform
MicroMoney which is currently hosting its initial coin offering, claims to be the first blockchain credit bureau and social micro-finance service. MicroMoney has raised over six million dollars and counting, with a goal of thirty million dollars by the end of their ITO.

Without access to basic financial services, the unbanked have limited capacity to overcome poverty and to increase their living standards. No credit history means limited access to banking services, which means no loans or mortgages. MicroMoney hopes to change all of that with a simple app.

The next billion internet users will primarily be mobile. Many of the unbanked lack access to infrastructure including reliable electricity and internet, forcing them to rely heavily on smartphones. With this in mind, MicroMoney has put an emphasis on mobile app development. By analyzing an individual’s smartphone, the company can learn everything they need to know in order to accurately estimate their creditworthiness.


They have developed an app that gathers 10,000 different data parameters. They then analyze this data using AI Neural Network Scoring, determining a loan approval decision in just 15 seconds. The goal is to make borrowing money using their app as easy as ordering an Uber.

Simplicity and ease of access has led to 90% of MicroMoney customers taking their very first loan. Currently MicroMoney operates in Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand with plans for aggressive expansion throughout Asia. In August 2017, MicroMoney signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Everex e-wallet. Everex is a crypto-based company operating in the remittance industry. Integration of Everex allows for customers to secure crypto-loans disbursed through global remittance.


MicroMoney currently operates in Cambodia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand
Bringing financial services to the unbanked could have a major impact on developing nations and society as a whole. Regions that have experienced extreme poverty and limited growth for decades, will for the first time have access to banking, credit and loans. The expansion of the internet led to a boom in ideas and creativity. Bringing 2 billion unbanked into the global economy has the potential to create a massive economic boom on the scale of the industrial revolution.

Micromoney is already seeing success in the countries they currently operate within, with users of the micro-loan service posting stories on social media accounts and to the company. One of the micro-loan customers, Thet Zaw, wrote on Facebook about his experience using Micromoney service:

One day my son felt very ill, so I needed money urgently. I asked my friend for money but he couldn’t help me. Then I saw MicroMoney page on Facebook and applied for a loan. 2 days ago I got my first loan, which was not a lot of money but saved my son’s life.

Cryptocurrency may be exactly what the world needs to level the financial playing field. The new digital economy will provide global financial freedom and inclusion to billions.

					<p localizerid="faq-5">
			Business is increasingly globalized and decentralized, and we live in challenging times.

A couple of years ago I thought I needed a new challenge in my life, and some time later we packed and moved to Southeast Asia to turn a new page and become pioneers in the payday loan industry. We saw it as an opportunity to enable global inclusion for unbanked people, so in our venture my wife and I chose Cambodia for our home base.

Now that we’ve opened new offices in Myanmar, Thailand and Sri-Lanka, our decision to start with Cambodia can be seen as a definitive step which enabled us to embrace the largest community of unbanked people in the region, bringing the advantages of Blockchain as the key technology for global financial inclusion.

Cambodia is all about banks
For us as Europeans, the first surprise was the population’s absolute trust in local banks.
The US dollar is as used in Cambodia as the local currency is, and the exchange rate has remained stable for over 20 years. State regulators do not exercise particular pressure on the financial industry, and by the time we stepped into the game, 50 organizations had been involved in the consumer loan industry, each with an average capital of $1.5 mln and an ARPU of $5,000.

With such a lax attitude to banking and loaning, the local banks and microfinance organizations wouldn’t lend a cent without collateral and papers.

Usually, people give real estate or land property security and have to bring at least five certificates, passports and a person ready to vouch for the borrower.

It works: 30-day overdue loans in Cambodia account for only 0.9 percent of the total, so the PAR ratio (portfolio at risk) is quite profitable (according to the local Central Bank).

We decided to pursue a goal of eliminating obstacles on the way to global inclusion, and put trust in Blockchain: the technology offered an opportunity to get rid of numerous papers and jump over banks’ legacy approach to fully digitized and secured customer data.

Our Cambodian lessons
Having developed a real business in Cambodia, we developed a simple checklist to score a country and find out whether it might work to run operations there. Some might find it useful, especially when looking towards promising Southeast Asian countries:

A growing share of the middle class due to the growth of GDP. For instance, Cambodian GDP grew six percent in 2016.
A market capable of generating cheap leads. We discovered all Cambodians belonging to the target audience have at least one active Facebook account, and for them Facebook often equals Internet in general: every national mobile operator provides free access to Facebook.
Dormant or non-existent competition. in Cambodia there were no paperless lending services without an escrow of land or real estate property.
Eager audience in need of a product. when we were checking out the market, we found only five percent of the population had a credit record. According to McKinsey, the number of ‘unbanked’ people in Asian region overall ranges from 65 to 80 percent of the adult population.
Collaboration at the local level. It helped us understand local customers and comply with local regulations (in this case you must be ready to assign 51 percent of your newly established company to a local partner).
Be open: local partners are essential to your success
"In the turbulent waters of Asian business realities, we understood that a well-established local partner is what can fuel your business ambition."

When launching our operations, we considered about thirty local organizations and eventually found excellent partners. Tetsuji Nagata, one of our co-owners, brought along a Japanese venture fund, East Wing ASA Capital, with capital of about $100 mln, and became our co-founder with a share of 50 percent.

A local businessman with a Khmer background (Oknha Sorn Sokna), counselor for economic affairs of the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Sen, and CEO of Sonatra, one of the largest development companies in the country, provided us with an office space and full legal support in Cambodia.

Look at who you hire - they are a reflection of your average customer
We have learned the hard way how it is to find local employees, which led us to a number of cultural discoveries. This was a way to learn our potential customers and get a deep-dive into their peculiarities and psychology.

They are not kings of planning and forward-thinking. This explains loan services’ popularity over long-term deposits or projects: the key goal for a person is to get some money for immediate purpose - right here, right now.
Patriarchal society and strong nepotism contribute to employees’ motivation. When hiring, we had to persuade our employees that our company is their family and the manager is a patriarch, in order to motivate them.
Teamwork matters. The Cambodians, as many people in South-East Asia, tend to be very social and they work more effectively in teams rather than individually, which presents a striking contrast to European or American individualism.
Money is not the key driver and motivator. Earning is not the main reason why Cambodians go to work. An employee can quit anytime they feel they are treated badly, and nothing can hold them - they are likely to leave the very second they feel their work is not appreciated or valued. This helped us to understand why a lot of our borrowers change their jobs quite a lot and adapt the scoring system accordingly.
Single-tasking beats multi-tasking. Cambodian employees are not great multitaskers. They are not capable of working efficiently when burdened by several KPIs simultaneously.
As a foreign company, you have to earn the locals’ trust. Foreign companies are not trusted a lot, so to improve corporate image as a good employer, you need to put forward some advantages of having a working relationship with you.
"Having understood the correlation between local employees and local customers, we decided to evaluate solvency/trustworthiness just the way we designed: we scored candidates the way we scored borrowers. Having interviewed over 400 applicants, we found the 20 best-performers."

You are a helper rather than a conqueror
There was a reason why we decided to choose Cambodia and Southeast Asia to build our new business.

We took on a great mission to help two bln unbanked people become part of a global financial ecosystem. Due to the rigid conditions under which Cambodian banks are ready to lend, the majority of people prefer to stay aside.

When we designed a solution to eliminate this obstacle, we had seen tens of thousand of customers try our app. About 90 percent of our borrowers take their very first loan ever, and 75 percent of customers have an average income of $200 per month.

For 15 percent of borrowers, payday loans became a means of covering their daily needs (this applies not only to end users, but to small businesses as well - think street food providers who buy groceries in the morning and earn the money necessary to return the loan by end of day).

"For 35 percent of borrowers, a loan was needed to cover the costs of a wedding present, which is of great significance in the country."

Our scoring system evaluates the number of parameters it gets from the user questionnaire, approving one per each six applications. We reject an application in 23 percebt of cases, due to the absence of regular work, in 20 percent of cases due to refusal to provide contacts, and in seven percent of cases due to false information.

The conversion from the first to the second and further loans is quite high, and amounts up to 73 percent. Thirty-four per cent of clients take five or more loans, and seven percent of users take ten and more. The sweet spot of our audience is four percent of clients who borrowed money fifteen or more times.

Take on Facebook for an efficient promo
Our website and Facebook account are our major promo tools in Cambodia.

Having placed a loan calculator and lending conditions on the website, we have seen a sincere reaction from the clients via Facebook - which is the key web resource that people visit daily, thanks to mobile service providers.

Our fan base grew up to 500,000 legitimate fans, all of them ready to relate their experience with us - nothing we have ever seen anywhere else. Cambodians are a very sincere people.

The market is ready to technology advancements
Technology proved to be our greatest asset and an indisputable advantage for our customers.

We based our scoring system on a neural network, and when our application provides access to their social media profile data, customers feed an infinite pool of unstructured data to the neural network engine and help it learn more correlations, and assess the credit score more accurately.

"Cambodians are unwilling to provide a pile of papers to the bank in order to get a loan worth $30, and they favoured an opportunity to tick a couple of boxes and get their money in a matter of minutes."

Some of them are ready to provide more data to the neural network, which essentially makes them available for offers from other banks, telecom providers and retailers. When it happens, we consider our mission accomplished, since we were able to provide a person with an initial credit record and make them entitled to further interactions with the market.

We are on the way towards developing the first Blockchain-based credit bureau, which will enable us to store credit records in a secure, decentralized and accessible manner.

Cambodia: aftermath
Cambodia was a start of a long road. Having established operations in Cambodia, we moved on to use the same working model to launch operations in Myanmar, Sri-Lanka, Indonesia and Thailand, thus growing our business and learning more and more from the lessons of Cambodia.

Southeast Asia is an exciting market: people are up for new challenges for a better quality of life, and this presents a promising audience for many good ventures, due to the fast return of investments.

It’s also a real challenge to work in a country which is so excitingly different, and our Cambodian lessons helped us to take on new goals and opportunities in the region.

				<h5 localizerid="faq-6" id="tab-3">After Crackdown, Nearly Every Chinese ICO Returns Cash To Investors</h5>
				<div class="body">
					<p localizerid="faq-7">

Nearly a billion dollars have been reportedly returned to Chinese investors that put money to work in some 40-plus initial coin offerings (ICO) that took place on the mainland this year. Though a better word for "returned" may be '"redirected." China's central bank banned ICOs on Sept. 4 and later banned all bitcoin exchanges from operating in the country. An ICO is a crypto-currency funding mechanism for start-ups.

Xinhua news reported on Sept. 22 that 90% of the money had been returned to investors. They did not say how much had been returned. But between January and August, over $1.1 billion had been raised in more than 65 ICOs, according to government figures.

"To understand what’s going on with ICOs and China you need to understand that fundamentally are two kinds of Chinese," says Anton Dzyatkovsky, CEO of MicroMoney, a global fintech blockchain company and lending services provider based in Singapore. He was speaking fresh off the Global Blockchain Summit in Wanxiang, where many bright-eyed Chinese are looking forward to a digital economy.


"The first kind is afraid of everything, to the point that some execs didn’t come to the recent blockchain summit because the event had the word 'blockchain' in its name, and they feared that Chinese police would take their picture there and use that as evidence to repress them later on. The second kind of Chinese is the type that is not afraid of anything. And these are the ones who are re-registering their blockchain companies in Hong Kong and Singapore, and will continue operations shut down by the central bank," Dzyatkovsky says.

One of the reasons regulators put the lid on ICOs was because of the Chinese penchant for gambling. It's one thing to gamble on regulated securities. Another to lose your shirt on a digital currency backed by nothing but the sellers good word and business plan. Pre-ICO roadshows featuring elaborate standing room-only presentations at 5-star hotels drew a diverse crowd, including grandmothers -- a likely tipping point for the People's Bank of China, Reuters reported.

The crackdown came just weeks before the gathering of the people's congress of the Communist Party, a once-in-five-years event. Beijing has been waging a broader campaign against fraudulent fundraising, speculative investment, and corruption and bitcoin fits neatly in those cross-hairs.

At least for now. China is a huge player in this market, with some of the biggest bitcoin miners located there. By cracking down on the crypto-currency trade and all that orbits the world of bitcoin and ether, China is at risk of losing out on a major new development in financial technology.

From Blockchains To Mooncakes: Two Chinese Crypto Founders On The Latest ICO And Bitcoin Exchanges Ban -- Forbes podcast "Unchained" by Laura Shin

Bitcoin exchanges allow for investors to buy and sell crypto-currencies. ICOs allow investors to use crypto currencies to buy so-called tokens in new start-ups. These tokens act like coupons for services provided by the company they belong to.

The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) released a statement about China's decision, reminding the market that crypto has a green light on the peninsula. “Where the digital tokens involved in an ICO fall under the definition of "securities," dealing in or advising on the digital tokens, or managing or marketing a fund investing in such digital tokens, may constitute a ‘regulated activity',” the statement read. Those wishing to engage in such activity would have to first obtain the requisite license from the SFC.

During the Wanxiang blockchain conference, rumor was that some companies were devising clever ways to get that money back. They had already begun to return the money, and would re-register the deal to Hong Kong and Singapore where crypto currencies are bound to securities law. There, the company founders would collect most of the money back from their investors in Hong Kong or Sing.

Some Chinese players are still holding onto the money.

One is NEO, a Chinese crypto-currency platform similar to Ethereum, which launched its ICO in 2016. They said they are not planning to return any funds unless individual token holders asked for their money back. It is unclear how many have done so at this time.

"China remains open for business, so long as your company is headquartered elsewhere," says Dzyatkovsky, who is trying to bring MicroMoney to China.

On Sept. 15, Chinese government officials informed two prominent exchanges, Huobi and OKCoin, that they would have to stop trading by October 31, 2017.

"Governments fear that tokens offer a backdoor to circumvent their authority on currency control and regulation," says Los Angeles based attorney Katrina Arden for the Blockchain Law Group. "Many of these fears stem from not understanding the nature of the blockchain technology underlying (cyber-currency) infrastructure."
