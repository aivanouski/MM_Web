				<h5 localizerid="faq-87" id="tab-42">I have never heard of you. Who are you?</h5>
				<div class="body">
					<p localizerid="faq-88">We started our microlending business in Cambodia in 2015, with a $30,000 starup capital. Then we have discovered an amazing statistic, that 9 of 10 of our clients take our loan as their first loan in their life, at the same time being completely unknown by traditional financial institutions. This helped us to develop a unique scoring algorithm which identifies solvensy of all clients via their usage of the mobile app. By September 2017 we achieved the following:
- 95,000 unique registred users;
- Over 530,000+ likes on our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/micromoneymyanmar/)
- $1.85 million worth of contributions to our business;
- offices in three countries: Myanmar, Cambodia, Thailand;
- three more offices are about to be opened in Sri-Lanka, Indonesia and Philippinnes;
- six more countries on the roadmap: we have already prepared a business plan and the stationary resources and are looking for local partners in these geographies;
In October 2017 we are launching a token distribution campaign.</p>

				<h5 localizerid="faq-89" id="tab-43">What is the problem you are going to solve?</h5>
				<div class="body">
					<p localizerid="faq-90">There is a global problem:
1. About 2 billion people worldwide use cash only, since traditional banks and financial organizations tend to leave them aside for being too 'risky' and 'uncertain' customers.
2. Major Businesses do not know much about these potential customers, as they still remain in the 'grey zone'; instead, banks prefer to reach customers in the first world countries. Therefore, a substantial financial revenue still remains excluded from the global economy.

We all know people do need money, they want to consume, use different services & spend, while businesses need new, fresh & financially prospect clients.

				<h5 localizerid="faq-91" id="tab-44">What is the solution you offer and what is the value you create?</h5>
				<div class="body">
					<p localizerid="faq-92">We are developing a blockchain and Big Data based credit bureau. 1) Since 2015, all of our borrowers in Cambodia and Myanmar who have a smartphone were able to apply for a loan. All they needed to do was to install our app; then, our scoring algorithm based on machine learning and neural networks processes the loan approval in just 15 seconds. This algorithm analyses over 10,000 different parameters at the same time and learns how to assess risks accurately with every new loan application. A borrower does not need to present collateral or papers – they just install an app and get their loan which is transferred to their bank card. As of now, our default risks do not cap 2-5%, which is an unthinkable benchmark for traditional banks. For 9 of 10 of our clients, it is the first loan in their lives, and 73% of clients return back to us for more services. On average, one person applies for 4.5 loans per year. Our Facebook page has over 530,000 followers and a number of grateful reviews from real people (https://www.facebook.com/micromoneymyanmar/) 2) We are constantly accumulating valuable Big Data insights, which enables us to offer free access to depersonalized data and paid access to personalized data, which is of great value for many businesses. For instance, in the US, the cost of client acquisition is $10 to $200, whereas in our case this figure does not exceed $1. Of course, our clients’ salary won’t exceed $200-$500 a month if compared to an average $5,000 worth paycheck in US, but in our case client acquisition costs 100-fold less. What is also important to note that we run an initial ‘due diligence’ for each of these clients, calculate their risk score, handle KYC assessment and store up to 10,000 scoring parameters we get from the clients’ smartphones, including geolocation, social media data, contact lists and SMS (all with client’s consent). All of this makes our client data cheap, relevant and abundant, whilst our clients become recognized and verified for a number of companies who need cheap leads: retailers, insurance companies, banks, and financial institutions. As for depersonalized data, it is also of great relevance and value, since it can be used in a statistical modelling. In order to access the data accumulated by our Open Source Big Data & Credit Record Bureau, a stakeholder needs to have a certain number of AMM tokens on their balance and use them to pay for personalized data. The profit we receive is split between our company and the client who consented to sharing their personal information. We use this profit to invest into a further development and expansion. All data is stored in the blockchain ledger in a secure and transparent manner. The data can be accessed from anywhere in the world; this model contributes to our clients’ personal digitalized reputation and offers them an opportunity to earn by simply sharing their data. </p>

				<h5 localizerid="faq-93" id="tab-45">Who are your clients? How many are they?</h5>
				<div class="body">
					<p localizerid="faq-94">On the one hand, our customers are buyers and suppliers of credit histories: classical banks, credit services (fiat and crypto-currency), insurance companies, P2P platforms, telecommunications and utilities.</p>
	<p localizerid="faq-95">On the other hand, our other clients are 2 billion unbanked people around the world. For example, Cambodian banks offer only loans which are secured by land ownership, while Myanmar banks require minimum six documents to apply for a simple loan. In Thailand, a spoilt credit record closes any opportunities to apply for a loan, however insignificant it might be.</p>
	<p localizerid="faq-96">It is essential to note that the population of unbanked people exceeds 2 billion figure. Anyone among us can easily face the same situation.</p>
	<p localizerid="faq-97">When you move to another country, you immediately fall into the ‘unbanked’ category. Imagine trying to withdraw cash at the ATM and pay exorbitant surcharge for conversion and withdrawal every time. Also, an expat is not entitled to apply for a loan at any local bank, due to the absence of the credit record. With no credit record, one does not have a reputation of a financially reliable person, which leads to higher charges for long-term rent wherever you go.</p>

				<h5 localizerid="faq-98" id="tab-46">Aren't you loan sharks just like anyone else?</h5>
				<div class="body">
					<p localizerid="faq-99">No, we are completely different from traditional banks and financial organizations. 1) We issue loans to those who cannot get any service from traditional banks and financial organizations, since such clients are too risky and expensive to acquire. Unbanked people remain in the 'grey zone' for usual banks and financial organizations. However, unbanked people are just like everyone else: most of them earn $200-500 and SMBs. For 9 of 10 of our clients the loan we offer is the first loan in their lives. 2) We offer unbanked people an opportunity to get a real credit record which can be used anywhere around the world and prove they are reliable and solvent clients. This initial credit score would enable them to develop their businesses, apply for a student loan or mortgage, pay for medical services and wedding parties, or get insured - in other words, to open up new, previously inaccessible services. Our Facebook page we have received a huge number of grateful posts and recommendations - https://www.facebook.com/micromoneymyanmar/ 3) People who get loans from us can be rewarded for providing their personal information. For this, we share a portion of profit with our clients - this is something no one has ever done before. Our call centres do everything to improve people's financial illiteracy. This is not a figure of speech: it is real work we do every day. Please check out our Youtube channel to see how it works: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKVXG3WEYPyxmsnwClF5vPg/videos</p>

				<h5 localizerid="faq-100" id="tab-47">How does the scoring system work? How do you assess credit solvency of a borrower?</h5>
				<div class="body">
					<p localizerid="faq-101">A borrower downloads our mobile application and he/she will use it to apply for a loan by completing a questionnaire. Our scoring system will assess over 15 different data sources, collecting both conventional (like data from the questionnaire) and non-conventional parameters like data from the application, social networks or HR websites. Further, the neural network based system uses all collected data to generate up to 10,000 measurable parameters for each applicant. A solvent borrower does not have to contribute any extra documents to get approved for their loan, while an insolvent borrower would get a rejection, no matter how hard he/she tried to fake answers. </p>
	<p localizerid="faq-102">Our scoring system can collect over 50 scoring parameters by just assessing the music library on your smartphone. It can find correlations between the likeability of credit default and genres of music tracks (or proportion of various genres in the music collection). A curious example is the fact that hip-hop aficionados are less likely to return their loans. There is another fascinating discovery: a person storing thousands of music tracks is associated with a strong likelihood of credit default.</p>

					<p localizerid="faq-136">Majority of our clients are really responsible, and the number of overdue payments is much lower in comparison to many well-established traditional banks in Europe and USA: 95% of our clients are first-time borrowers and do care about their initial credit record.</p>
	<p localizerid="faq-137">Please explain your strategy in detail.</p>
	<p localizerid="faq-138">1) We diversify risks by lending small amounts: for example, the value of the first-time loan in Myanmar does not exceed $23. The average customer acquisition cost us only $1, while In Europe it can be up to 200 EUR and about $10 - 100 in the US where these customers are already heavily burdened by loans and mortgages.</p>
	<p localizerid="faq-139">2) We increase all loans payments gradually, by offering more $ with each new loan, which helps us to identify insolvent borrowers at the stage of the third or fourth loan</p>
	<p localizerid="faq-140">3) The borrowers apply for a loan through our mobile app. Their smartphone knows a lot more about its user than anyone else. Our app is aware that the borrower, for example, stores up to 300-500 contacts in the contact book or has a family. We know exactly how many friends our borrower has, and whether he or she tends to be friends with trustworthy/untrustworthy people (which is also analyzed by a neural network). Also, we know which social media accounts are associated with the customer’s profile, thus establishing a continuous connection between a lender and borrower, even in the event of a SIM card loss. We have access to SMS traffic from banks, telecommunication providers and utility companies since we use this information when assessing the credit score. It is of paramount importance that we access this data only upon clearly articulated consent from the client. This is a win-win scenario: we provide necessary financial support in return for valuable customer data.</p>

				<div class="body">
					<p localizerid="faq-148">We cannot speak for everyone, but we do believe that there is a high % of campaigns which can be seen as scams indeed. Anyone who wants to participate in any project, needs to make sure the company behind the project is trustworthy and the risk of losing money is minimal. This also makes sense regarding traditional financial markets and other opportunities.</p>

				<h5 localizerid="faq-156" id="tab-69">Can you provide more details about your franchise model? Who are your partners in other countries? How do you plan to expand to new markets?</h5>
				<div class="body">
					<p localizerid="faq-157">It’s a win-win approach: we provide IT expertise while our partners offer us insights about the local market.</p>
	<p localizerid="faq-158">For instance, McDonalds has one of the most efficient business models: 80% of their restaurants are franchise businesses or joint ventures with a local partner. We have elaborated a well-structured and standardized model. We have aligned and documented our business processes and are ready to expand our business. To start with, we have tested all processes within our home-base location, gained insights for markets in China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Philippines, Myanmar, Indonesia, Sri-Lanka, Thailand and Australia. We are ready to roll out operations there. We have launched business successfully in two countries already and are fully equipped to expand to other markets as well. The story is as follows: we were planning to open representative offices in the targeted location, but it brings a complexity, since we need to rent office space, hire a COO, and HR manager and at least a dozen of employees in each market. Then we decided to open a multinational central office and hire a multilingual customer service team to serve all markets from a single hub. When we outreached to our peers from the microfinancing industry (namely in Indonesia and Sri-Lanka) and asked them to recommend reliable, reputable employees. Both of our acquaintances offered to establish local partnerships, which would help them launch operations in their home markets. That was when we understood that we found a perfect, win-win business expansion strategy. We always stress our 360-degree ‘win-win’ approach as the cornerstone of our business model. In this case, it is also based on simple logic: while we are professionals in IT, we can take advantage of seasoned local experts who have expertise on a similar market and are willing to efficiently scale business while involving as less resources as possible. It took us two years to developed a CRM system and fine-tune our risk management platform by bringing in neural networks, and with a current technology development space, there is work to do for years ahead. While we are IT experts, it is very unwise to think we have necessary expertise in each country: in order to have it, we would have needed to learn local regulation frameworks in all details and hire right employees, but we do not have time to waste on micromanagement.</p>

				<h5 localizerid="faq-160" id="tab-70">What if your partner is a stong competitor of yours?</h5>
				<div class="body">
					<p localizerid="faq-161">We are able to easily turn a competitor into a partner, and we know how to do it. We plan a global expansion by finding a trustworthy experienced partner in each country, offering two options: a joint venture or a franchise contract. We know it is hard to enter a financial market in a new country. There are a number of legislative hurdles for new players, whilst a local player also has a challenge to grow and compete against other companies: usually their resources are limited and they do not have enough experience to develop a working IT solution which would give them a competitive edge. We can offer a complete CRM system based on Big Data analysis over a neural network. We are ready to offer such a solution free of charge in case a partner uses our brand and forms a joint venture with us. </p>
